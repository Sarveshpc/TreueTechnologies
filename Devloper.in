// User class to store user information // Task 1 :
//Online Parking Systems :
public class User {
    private String username;
    private String password;
    private String email;

    // Getters and setters
}

// User authentication logic
public class AuthenticationService {
    public boolean registerUser(User user) {
        // Implement user registration logic and store user data in the database
        // Return true on success, false on failure
    }

    public boolean authenticateUser(String username, String password) {
        // Implement user authentication logic
        // Return true if the credentials are valid, false otherwise
    }
}


part 2 :

//Parking Spot Management System :

// ParkingSpot class to store parking spot information
public class ParkingSpot {
    private int spotNumber;
    private String location;
    private boolean isAvailable;
    // Other attributes

    // Getters and setters
}

// Parking spot management logic
public class ParkingSpotService {
    public List<ParkingSpot> searchAvailableSpots(String location, Date date, Time startTime, Time endTime) {
        // Implement a method to search for available parking spots based on criteria
        // Return a list of available spots
    }

    public boolean bookParkingSpot(User user, ParkingSpot spot, Date date, Time startTime, Time endTime) {
        // Implement booking logic
        // Return true on successful booking, false otherwise
    }
}


//part 3 : Booking Confirmations :
// Booking class to store booking information
public class Booking {
    private int bookingId;
    private User user;
    private ParkingSpot parkingSpot;
    private Date date;
    private Time startTime;
    private Time endTime;
    private double price;
    // Other attributes

    // Getters and setters
}

// Booking confirmation logic
public class BookingService {
    public Booking confirmBooking(User user, ParkingSpot spot, Date date, Time startTime, Time endTime) {
        // Implement booking confirmation logic
        // Return a Booking object on successful confirmation, null otherwise
    }
}

//4. Real-Time Updates:

Implementing real-time updates would typically require additional technologies such as WebSocket or Server-Sent Events (SSE), which are beyond the scope of simple Java code. You may need to use a web framework that supports real-time communication.

5. Payment Integration:

Integrate a payment gateway by utilizing a payment processing library or service compatible with Java.

Remember that this is a basic Java code outline, and building a complete online parking system would require a lot more code, a database system (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL), and possibly a web framework like Spring Boot or Java Servlets for the web-based front end. Additionally, security, error handling, and other important aspects should be thoroughly addressed during development.
